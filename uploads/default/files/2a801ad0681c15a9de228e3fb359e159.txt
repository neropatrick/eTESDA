	<title>Computer Network </title>
	<text>What is a network?

A network is the interconnection of computers, devices and peripherals to allow them to communicate, share or print data and information.

There are two types of networks:

1. Local Area Network (LAN)

The Local Area Network or LAN is the interconnection of computers and devices using a hub, switch or router within a small area such as building, school, office or home. </text>

	<text> Types of Network Models
1. The Client - Server Model

The Client-Server model consists of one or more servers that provide services / applications or resources to one or more individual computers called clients. The client and server communicates using a computer network. An example of a Client – Server Model is the Internet.

A server is a computer providing one or more services (printing, file, data and information sharing, email, and other applications) to serve other computers and devices. A server machine runs the different programs or applications and services which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources but requests a server's content or service function.
A client is a computer or device that is requesting a service or resources from a server. The client computer sends the request to the server machine.</text>

	<title>Network Topology</title>

What is the Network Topology?

It is a representation or structure of a network that deals with different types of interconnectivity. 

What are the types of Network Topologies?

Network topologies are categorized into the following basic types:

1. Bus Topology

The Bus Topology uses a common cable to connect all the computers. A computer wanting to communicate with another computer on the network sends the message to all computers through the cable, but only the target computer accepts the message.

	<title>Summary</title>
	<text> 
A Network is the interconnection of computers, devices and peripherals to allow them to communicate, share or print data and information.

A Network Topology is the layout pattern representation of the interconnection of all the computers, nodes, links and other peripherals of a network. It shows the structure and transmission links that connect nodes in a network.
