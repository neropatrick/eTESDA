	<title>Step 1: Setting up the boot option </title>
	<text> Why do we need to set the computer to boot from the CD-ROM drive?

Normally a computer system boots from the hard drive. From here, the computer loads the operating system that is installed on the computer system. 
Since we are installing a new operating system on the computer, and our installation files are stored in a CD-ROM, we need to set the computer to boot from the CD-ROM drive instead. This is done in the BIOS setup.

Procedure:

Turn on the computer.
Press the Delete key while the computer is starting up to enter the BIOS setup. This will work on most computer systems. </text>

	<title>Step 2: Partitioning the hard drive </title>
	<text> Disk partitioning is simply dividing your hard drive into multiple volumes known as logical drives.
As an example, if you have a 500 GB hard drive, you can divide the hard drive into two volumes, each with 250GB (e.g. 250 GB drive C: and 250 GB drive D:). By doing this, you can install the operating system and applications in one volume and your data and documents in another volume.

In case the operating system gets corrupted and needs to be re-installed, you can do so without losing documents and other data since these are stored in another partition.</text>

	<title>Step 3: Formatting the hard drive </title>
	<text> Why do we need to format the hard drive?

Formatting the hard drive is a process that prepares the hard drive for writing and reading data. The process involves erasing all data stored on the hard drive. It also tests the disk for errors and corrects them if any are found. 

When formatting the hard drive, we need to specify a file system. In Windows XP, we can select either the FAT32 or NTFS.</text>

	<title>Step 4: Setting up the Windows environment  </title>
	<text>Setting the Windows environment lets you localize the version of Windows you are installing. For example, if you want to display text in Chinese, you can set this in the Regional and Language Options.
Procedure:

When Windows XP starts for the first time it will scan for any new hardware and will install the needed drivers of the supported devices, this may take several minutes to complete.</text>

	<title> Step 5: Setting up the computer name and administrator account   </title>
	<text>The Computer name is used to identify your computer in a network. This name should be unique for each computer.

The Administrator is a super user account that has no restrictions. This account may be used to set configuration options (e.g. network settings, install software and perform other administrative tasks).</text>
